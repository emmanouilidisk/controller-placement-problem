<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The repository includes the implementation of the project "A Comparative Study of Algorithms for the Controller Placement Problem", conducted as part of the Software Defined Networks (SDN) course in JHU.

  
This implementation includes:
- the k-center Algorithm   
- the k* - Means Algorithm from the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8337381) of Kuang et al.   
- the k- Self-Adaptive Algorithm from the [paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1631/FITEE.1500350.pdf) of Xiao et al.

The topologies used are parsed from the [Internet Topology Zoo database](http://www.topology-zoo.org/).
